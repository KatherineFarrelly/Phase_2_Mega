# Phase_2_Mega
 Arduino code for the Phase 2 of the Soil Robot Project
# What is this code
This code does a few things: <br>
1. It reads all the sensors on the robot <br>
2. It controls all the stepper motors on the robot <br>
3. It makes sure the gantry stays in bounds <br>
4. It recieves and interprets commands through serial from a host computer (through the Autoweigh UI) <br>
5. It sends weight data from the soil samples on the robot back to the host computer. <br>
# Hardware
This code is meant to be uploaded to an Arduino Mega 2560.
